The goal of this analysis is to improve sales, enhance customer retention, and streamline operational efficiency. Using tools like Excel, Power Query, and Power BI, the data has been cleaned, visualized, and summarized to provide valuable recommendations.
### PROBLEM STATEMENT

#### SKILLS DEMONSTRATED AND TOOLS USED
1. Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization
2. Tool used: Excel, PowerQuery, PowerBI

##### STEPS TAKEN
1. I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset using Excel.  
2. I imported the dataset into Power Query to identify any inconsistencies or errors, checking each column for validity or missing data.  
3. I changed the *TECH* TO *TECHNOLOGY* to group them into the same category in the category name column. 
4. I standardized the *SHIPPING TYPE* field by changing entries labeled *LATE * and *LATE* to LATE DELIVERY.  
5. I modified columns by separating *TIME* from *OTHER DATE*.   
6. I renamed *HOME* to *HOME OFFICE* for consistency.  
8. I Corrected *FURNITURES* to *FURNITURE* for proper categorization.
9. I used DAX measures to calculate the TOTAL CUSTOMERS, RETURNING CUSTOMERS, and RETENTION RATE.
10. I did the data visualization.
11. Finally creationg a dashboard.

###### CONCLUSION

Products under the "Consumer" category generated the highest revenue, making them a crucial driver of overall sales performance.
Returning customers contributed significantly to revenue. However, the retention rate was only 14%, indicating a need to improve first-time customer engagement and loyalty.
The West region generated the highest revenue while Central and South regions underperformed despite having high market potential, suggesting untapped opportunities for growth. Late deliveries generated the highest revenue, indicating that customers were not deterred by delays and continued to make purchases.
Orders below $200 were categorized as LOW, yet they accounted for the highest sales volume, highlighting the importance of small but frequent purchases to the company’s success.


###### RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

1. Prioritize promoting and maintaining inventory for the Consumer product category.
2. Introduce personalized offers and discounts for products in this category to drive additional sales.
3. Introduce loyalty programs to incentivize first-time customers to return, such as discounts on second purchases or reward points.
4. Collect and analyze feedback from first-time customers to identify pain points and improve their experience.
5. Conduct market research to understand customer preferences and barriers in these regions( CENTRAL AND SOUTH).
6. Launch targeted marketing campaigns to increase awareness and engagement.
7. West Region: Leverage the success in the West by replicating strategies used there in other regions.
8. Develop strategies to increase the frequency of low-value orders, such as flash sales or “Buy More, Save More” campaigns.
9. Bundle products to encourage customers to increase their order value.
10. Although late deliveries did not deter customers, improving delivery times could further enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
11. Invest in logistics optimization to ensure timely deliveries, especially in underperforming regions.
